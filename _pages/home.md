*Computationally Designed Organism*: An organism that has been designed by AI.

# Background

In 2020 and 2021, Doug Blackiston, Sam Kriegman, Mike Levin and Josh Bongard published a series of papers describing the first Computationally Designed Organisms (CDOs). To immerse select members of academia, industry, and government in this burgeoning field, the first workshop on computationally designed organisms is being convened at the **University of Vermont** in Burlington, VT on **July 14 and 15, 2025**.

This first WCDO is modeled on the [1956 Dartmouth Conference on Artificial Intelligence](https://home.dartmouth.edu/about/artificial-intelligence-ai-coined-dartmouth), where the very term "AI" was introduced; the founding members realized they had common cause; and much of the framing was established for what has now blossomed into the ubiquitous technology we know today.
