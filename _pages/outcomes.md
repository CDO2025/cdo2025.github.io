Three outcomes are expected. First, the invitees will come away with a deeper understanding of what CDOs are, and what their academic, industrial, therapeutic, and educational potential may be. Second, the invitees will jointly author a document detailing these potentials. Third, the invitees will develop and curate a growing list of individuals and institutions best poised to realize these potentials. Many of these individuals and institutions will be invited to a larger Workshop on Computationally Designed Organisms in the summer of 2026.
