Updating the CDO-2025 Webpage. 
The template is this: 

``https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes``

You can use it as a reference. 

Step 1:
Clone the repository to your local machine with:

``git clone https://github.com/CDO2025/cdo2025.github.io.git``

Step 2:
You can alter the global configuration by editing the ``config.yaml`` file (I have already done some basic tweaks). 

Step 3: Splash page
The splash page is stored in _pages/home.md (a markdown file).  

The title of the page is in the header (the text between the two ---). There are a bunch of different features you can tweak: the layout, the title, etc. Take a look at what parts of the text match to get a sense of what parts correspond to what visual features. 

Under the header, you can treat it like a Markdown file (Github pages is smart enough to compile Markdown into HTML syntax). 

Step 4: Other pages 
Every other page in the website lives in the _pages/ directory. The format of each one is [title].md. Each one stats with a header (the material between the two ---). If you want to include a YouTube video, check out _pages/images.md for an example. 

Step 5: Navigation bar
The bar at the top (which currently reads Code | Images and Video | Team | Contact) can be configured using the _data/navigation.yml file. The ``title`` key gives the term that will appear on the page. The ``url`` key gives the url. 

Note that it starts with a root url of /, which is a stand-in for the full website URL (https://cdo2025.github.io/). The root URL ID is fixed by the _config.yaml file (which I have already updated). 


Step 6: Images and videos
Images live in the _assets/images/ directory, videos on YouTube can be embedded directly with HTML code.
